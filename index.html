      <h1>What is cyber security? </h1>   

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Cyber security consists of the use of procedures and technologies to defend against cyberattacks on networks, systems, programmers and devices. The aim of cyber security is to reduce the chances of potential cyber-attacks and protect against the unauthorised exploitation of networks and technologies against theft and loss which could be used for ransom. </h5>   

    

<h5 class>There's a stigma that only organisations are at risk of cyber-attacks, but, everyone who uses the internet are at risk of cyber-attacks. Therefore, everyone who uses the internet should use preventions such as firewalls to limit the chances of cyber-attacks happening and taking place. </h5>   

    

    

<h5 class>Cyber security is often confused with information security. Information security is a wider category which safeguards all data and assets whether itâ€™s a hardcopy such as paper, or digital form. Whereas Cyber security focuses on protecting computer systems from unauthorised access. </h5>   

    

    

<h5 class>Cyber security is very vast and there are 5 types of cyber security. First is internet of things security. This involves protecting networks and smart devices connected to the internet. Iot devices are objects that connect to the Internet automatically, such as smart lighting, thermostats, fire alarms, and other equipment. The second type of cyber security is network security. This involves fixing flaws in your operating systems, network architecture, wireless access points, servers, hosts, firewalls, and network protocols. Another type of cyber security is application security, and this is addressing vulnerabilities originating from unsafe development procedures when creating, coding, and releasing software or a website. The fourth cyber security is cloud security. Cloud security consists of safeguarding applications, data and infrastructure in the cloud. The final cyber security is infrastructure security. These are the protocols, programs and technology used to protect critical infrastructure of nation states. </h5>    

    

         

    

      <h1>Why is Cyber Security important?   

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">With technology growing and getting more advance, there are more loopholes for cyber criminals to attack and gain access to important data. Being a victim of a cyber-attack can have many consequences that will negatively impact anorganisation. One consequence is fines. GDR Penalties can be issued to organisations that were breached. There are also many other non-financial consequences such as loss of trust between customers and the organisation. This is due to the fact that the organisation had the responsibility to keep the customers' data safe and secure, but they have failed. This can also lead to a negative image of the organisation. This will result in current and potential customers going elsewhere, which will then impact turnover and sales. </h5>
