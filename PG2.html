      <h1>Encryption </h1>   

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Data security's fundamental building block is encryption. It is the simplest and most crucial approach to guarantee that data on a computer system cannot be taken and read by someone who intends to use it maliciously. To secure user information transmitted between a browser and a server, both small businesses and individual users frequently use data security encryption </h5>   

<h1>Process </h1>   

<h5 class>There are two common techniques of encryption, such as symmetric encryption keys. Which is also known as private key encryption. It works best for single users and closed systems because the key needed to encode and decode is the same. If not, the receiver must receive the key. If a third party, such as a hacker, intercepts it, the risk of compromise rises. Compared to the asymmetric method, this one is quicker. </h5>    

   

<h5 class>The other common technique of encryption is asymmetric encryption keys. "asymmetric" refers to the fact that the keys are simply pairs of big numbers that aren't exactly the same. The owner keeps the private key a secret, while distributing or making the public key available to the public or only authorised recipients.  </h5>   

   

<h1>Advantages of encryption: </h1>   

    

<h5 class>An advantage of encryption is that it is cheap to implement, and it protects data from being stolen and used maliciously against remote workers. </h5>   

  <h5 class>Another advantage of encryption is that it can lower the chances of fines being made against an organisation as using encryption lowers the chances of cyber-attacks being made. There are no clear requirements for data encryption under legislation like the GDPR, but security measures and safeguards must be implemented to preserve the privacy of the data subjects, provided they are EU nationals. </h5>     

  <h1>Disadvantages of encryption: </h1>    

   <h5 class> There are only a few disadvantages for encryption such as :</h5>      

<h5 class>You could potentially lose your data if you lose your decryption keys as you won't be able to regain access to the data. </h5>    

    

    <h5 class>Another disadvantage is the main difficulties in the encryption process is key management. Only users who actually need access to encryption keys should be granted it. </h5>
